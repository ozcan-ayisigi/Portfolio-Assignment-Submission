# Portfolio Assignment - C# Projects

This repository contains various projects and exercises related to C# and .NET development. Each project demonstrates different concepts such as object-oriented programming, interfaces, operator overloading, and polymorphism.

## Project Files

### 1. Polymorphism.cs
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in C#. The `Employee` class implements the `IQuittable` interface, which includes a `Quit()` method. In the main program, polymorphism is demonstrated by treating an `Employee` object as an `IQuittable` object and calling the `Quit()` method.
- **Key Concepts**: Polymorphism, Interfaces, and Method Overriding.

### 2. Operator Assignment.cs
- **Description**: This project focuses on operator overloading. The `Employee` class has overloaded `==` and `!=` operators to compare two `Employee` objects based on their `Id`. It also overrides the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods to ensure proper comparison behavior.
- **Key Concepts**: Operator Overloading, Overriding Methods.
